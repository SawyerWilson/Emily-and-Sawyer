# Emily-and-Sawyer

Contributors: Sawyer Wilson and Emily Nadler

This is a collaborative project between Sawyer Wilson and Emily Nadler to 
create a website for their relationship at the domain EmilyAndSawyer.com

The website contains a timeline highlighting important memories and milestones
in their relationship through photos, videos, and descriptions. It also contains
shared dream boards where Sawyer and Emily can post photos that create a visual
representation of their goals, plans, and ideal future. This project itself 
is a way for Sawyer and Emily to learn web programming and collaborate 
together on a fun project.
