            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">  
                Welcome to our website! We decided to create this website as a fun way to learn web programming together 
                and make a creative space where we can store memories and dream boards. Making this website, we have already
                learned so much about HTML, CSS, and using Github through Atom and Visual Studio Code. We have also loved
                getting the chance to work on a project and create something special together. This website will always be
                a work in progress and we go through phases of working on it a lot and then taking a break from it. 
            </p>
